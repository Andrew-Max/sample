# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
  test = User.create( name: 'test', email: "test@test.com",
         password: "foobar", password_confirmation: "foobar")
